# Tailwind CSS Basics

Tailwind CSS is a **utility-first CSS framework** that helps you style websites quickly. Instead of writing custom CSS for every element, you use small pre-defined classes directly in your HTML or JSX.

## What Makes Tailwind Different?

Traditional frameworks like Bootstrap come with ready-made components. Tailwind, on the other hand, gives you **building blocks**. You combine these blocks to design your own unique styles.  

For example, you can set text size, background color, padding, and margins all by applying small class names.

## Common Tailwind Utilities

Here are some of the most used categories in Tailwind:

- **Spacing** → margin and padding  
- **Typography** → font size, weight, alignment  
- **Colors** → text colors, background colors, borders  
- **Layout** → flexbox, grid, alignment  
- **Borders and Radius** → rounded corners, border width

## Why Developers Love Tailwind

- **Responsive design** → built-in mobile-first classes

## Example Use Case

Imagine creating a button or a card. With Tailwind, you don’t need to write extra CSS. You just combine small classes for padding, color, borders, and hover effects.  

This makes it easy to experiment and change designs quickly.
